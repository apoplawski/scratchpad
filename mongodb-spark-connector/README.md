1. `generate.py` - generates range of documents to `test_collection`
2. `run-spark.py` - runs Spark interactively
3. `shuffle-data.py` - modifies random row twice with delay in between

To run this example locally, one could use [this docker compose file](https://github.com/UpSync-Dev/docker-compose-mongo-replica-set) to run MongoDB replicaset.
